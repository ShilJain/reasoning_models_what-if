<question>
Today’s date is 01-Apr-25.
As an appointment scheduler at Contoso Telco, your tasks are:
Identify the technician appointment requests that should be prioritized based on urgency, service type, location, customer tier and estimated duration.
Ensure that each type of service (e.g., installation, repair, maintenance) is booked regularly within recommended intervals.
For each appointment prioritized, provide a detailed rationale explaining why it should be scheduled in that order.
If a time slot cannot be allocated due to scheduling constraints, call that out in a separate section and recommend the next available slot and alternative arrangements.
You may adjust working hours for high-priority appointments if required, but aim to minimize changes to regular schedules.
